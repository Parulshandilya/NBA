Step 1 – Java Installation

You must have Java installed on the system before installing Apache Tomcat on a Linux VPS. Tomcat 9 required Java 8 or later version to work. You can check and verify that Java is installed with the right version.

java -version

java version "1.8.0_144"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_144-b01)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.144-b01, mixed mode)

If you don’t have Java installed on your system or installed a lower version, run below commands to satisfy requirements.

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install default-jdk
